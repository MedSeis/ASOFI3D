% Definition of (distributed) source positions: 
% position, time-delay, centre frequency, and amplitude
%
% (comment line is indicated by # as first character)
%
% Symbols: 
% XSRC= x-coordinate of source point [meter]
% YSRC= y-coordinate of source point [meter] (y denotes vertical direction in FDMPI !)
% ZSRC= z-coordinate of source point [meter]
% TD= excitation time (time-delay) for source node [s]
% FC= centre frequency of source signal [Hz]
% AMP= maximum amplitude of source signal
% NSRC= number of source positions
%
% Parameters for each source node (one source node per line):
%
%  NSRC (one line)
% 	XSRC		ZSRC		YSRC		TD		FC		AMP  (NSRC lines)
