#
# Definition of (distributed) source positions:
# position, time-delay, centre frequency, and amplitude
#
# (comment line is indicated by # or % as first character)
#
# Parameters for each source node (one source node per line):
#
# 	XSRC		YSRC		ZSRC		TD		FC		AMP
#
# Symbols:
# XSRC= x-coordinate of source point [meter]
# YSRC= y-coordinate of source point [meter] (vertical)
# ZSRC= z-coordinate of source point [meter]
# TD= excitation time (time-delay) for source node [s]
# FC= centre frequency of source signal [Hz]
# AMP= maximum amplitude of source signal
